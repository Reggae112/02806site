## Rise in forcible sexual offenses in the Bay Area

#### Introduction
Since 2003 San fransisco has been keeping a registry of all reported crimes. This allows us to look into both trends ands specifics of the crime data, the dataset contains data about the crime categories as well as temporal and geographic data, all of which we will use to examine an intersting trend that San Fransisco is experiencing. When looking at the overall dataset, the rise of one particular crime type came to our eye: forcible sexual offenses. At a first glance, this crime type seems to consistently increase in numbers every year, so we decided to look closer and further examine the hypothesis that San Fransisco is indeed experiencing a rise in forcible sex offenses.

#### Understanding the trend
In the above figure, we clearly see how the amount of forcible sex offenses are on a steady climb, at a rate much higher than the general development of reported crimes. This begs the question, what is it that is driving this ever increasing amount? Is it because of increasing crime number or due to a larger focus on the crime type from both law enforcement and citizens which leads to increased reporting. Such concepts can be hard to analyze on a quantitative level, one way we can try to get more insight is to examine the development of sex offenses in a more broad spectrum and see if this is an isolated trend or whether its part of a bigger picture. In the figure below you can see a comparison between the different types of sex related offenses and how their relative amount of the total reported crimes has developed over the years. 

#### A look into the geography of sex crimes
{% include Final_map.html %}

The map above shows the geographical distribution of forcible sex crimes for each of the years within the dataset. District borders have been highlighted and the number of total forcible sex offenses can be viewed by clicking on the district markers. When we view the map we see the same trend of increasing crimes. Although this seems to be the case across districts, there appears to be two hotspot(marked with red) areas with Tenderloin and its bordering districts and Mission having a much higher concentration of crimes and what also appears to be a steeper increase in crime numbers across time.

#### Crime rate of the individual districts
It can be difficult to accrately tell how large an increase a given district has experienced across the investigated period. The plot below therefore shows the development in forcible sex offenses of each district along with a trendline summarizing the development in crimes across time. The plot is interactive and each individual district can be turned on and off by clicking on its corresponding legend.
