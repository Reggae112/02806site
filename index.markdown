## Great News
We are more than a little thrilled to be presenting our second assignment on this webpage. Something which if we are honest, pushed our mental wellbeing to its limits. That said, here we are, standing in the sunshine that is an up an running git hub page powered by jekyll, with our past struggles now dissapering behind us leaving only a pleasant sense of accomplishment. We hope you enjoy the assignment which can be found by clicking the image below.
