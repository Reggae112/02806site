## Great News
We are more than a little thrilled to be presenting our second assignment on this webpageâ€”something which, if we are honest, pushed our mental wellbeing to its limits. That said, here we are, standing in the sunshine that is an up and running GitHub page powered by Jekyll, with our past struggles now disappearing behind us, leaving only a pleasant sense of accomplishment. We hope you enjoy the assignment, which can be found by clicking the image below.

## Even better News
It seems like summer has made its arrival here in Denmark - the parks are filled to the brim with happy people playing games and going for walks, the birds are singing and the streets are flowing over with the pedestrians of Copenhagen enjoying a well deserved but probably expensive beer. All the while this has been going on, we have been buried far away in another continent, deep within the open data of New York City. Luckily for both us and you dear reader, we are now finished, and you can get to enjoy our lovely final assignment by clicking the image below, while we can finally partake in the celebration by cracking open a cold beer - alcohol free of course.

### A little bonus content
If you need a little break from data viz, we recommend that you listen to Bob Dylan's "Visions of Johanna." It is probably one of the greatest songs of all time. Here is a 1966 live recording: (Based on Sune's inspiring acoustic video intros, we've gathered that he is a connoisseur of music. If you, the reader of this, are not Sune or for some reason despise classic bangers, then please skip this.)
